1. Explain what the terminal is in your own words.

	The terminal to me is like the back streets to your house. An easier, faster way to access locations in your computer so you can edit, add or look at something. 


2. What is the major difference between Git and Github?

	The difference between Git and Github is that Git is for code revisions and Github is a repository for your code.



3. Why do we use Github?
	We use Github because it is a more accessible way for one and their peers to communicate especially when performing group projects.
